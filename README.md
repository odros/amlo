This repository contains the code and documentation for the final project of the Introduction to Data Science course of Hertie School's Master of Data Science for Public Policy program.


### About our scripts, commenting and documentation
- A combination of regular argument passing to functions and piping is used
- All the functions used in our scripts will be explicit about the package they come from, unless they come from `base`
